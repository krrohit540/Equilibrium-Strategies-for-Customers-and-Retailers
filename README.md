# Equilibrium-Strategies-for-Customers-and-Retailers
(An Agent based Simulation Model)

The retail business in India is mostly dominated by small retailers having
very limited capital for further investment.In such circumstances,if big retail
houses are introduced,then it may signicantly change income distribution
scenario involving the whole retail chain in a manner which is very dicult
to predict the existing mathematical models.However,agent based simulation
models are very eective in this kind of emergence scenario both qualitatively
and quantitatively.
Here we consider the customer end of the retail chain.We consider a local-
ity with mixed population with varying purchasing capacities.The customers
strategy prole is the set of restaurants i.e. customer will choose one of the
restaurants based on the price and quality of the item and of course his pur-
chasing capacity..The restaurants strategy prole is the quality and price they
oer for each item.Hence,the system is modelled as a n-player non-cooperative
iterative game where each agent want to maximize their individual utility. As
the game proceeds the agents learn from their previous experience to choose
the next set of strategies.The utilities of the agents are recorded in each round
of the game and results are aggregated to obtain macro level indications.
From our study we observe that the completion scenario is accurately captured
in the model.The restaurants having best quality-price combination ultimately
wins majority of customers. The sensibility of customers response to the price
and quality have also been captured successfully.Though,we study the case of
restaurants yet the model is equally applicable in any retail scenario.Hence,the
model can be included as a module in the overall simulation of total retail
business chain.
